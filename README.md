# Fate/Grand Order (FGO) Arena

## Overview:
A survival of the fittest overthrow MOD inspired by Fate/Grand Order and Fate/Grand Order Arcade.

Stand near the Fantasy Tree to receive magical energy to strengthen your servant.
Make use of consumables and command spells to prevail against factions from other Lostbelts.

## Important notes/tips/guides:
* This game is heavily based on Dota2 mechanics and Fate series characters and skillset. Please read Fate/Grand Order wikia and Type-Moon Fate wikia if you dont have any knowledge about Fate series.
* Skills are heavily influenced by lores and I try to be as accurate as possible while keeping game balance.
* There is NO permanent items in this game except Blink Dagger and ONLY consumables like potions. 
* All heroes have high damage and can one-shot you instantly. Use scrolls to increase magic resistance/block X amount of damage.
* Turn on your sounds. All skills have sound cues and long ranged skills are audible from fog. Knowing these sound cues can save yourself.
* Use master1 to use Command Spells(refresh skills, refresh HP, refresh MP).
* Use master2 to exchange stats and powerful consumables.
* Make use of Dota2 quickbuy and sticky items to buy/combine items quickly.
