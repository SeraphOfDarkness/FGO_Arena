## Important notes/tips/guides:
* This game is heavily based on Dota2 mechanics and Fate series characters and skillset. Please read Fate/Grand Order wikia and Type-Moon Fate wikia if you dont have any knowledge about Fate series.
* Skills are heavily influenced by lores and I try to be as accurate as possible while keeping game balance.
* Pick your servant and class(Facet). Each class has its own unique class skills that provide gameplay advantage.
* Noble Phantasm(Combo skill) unlock at Lv15. Fill up NP gauge by taking damage and dealing damage. Use the skills in sequence correctly to activate it.
* There is NO permanent items in this game except Blink Dagger and ONLY consumables like potions. 
* All heroes have high damage and can one-shot you instantly. Use scrolls to increase magic resistance/block X amount of damage.
* Turn on your sounds. All skills have sound cues and long ranged skills are audible from fog. Knowing these sound cues can save yourself.
* Use master1(left on minimap) to use Command Spells(refresh skills, refresh HP, refresh MP).
* Use master2(right on minimap) to exchange stats and powerful consumables.
* Make use of Dota2 quickbuy and sticky items to buy/combine items quickly.
